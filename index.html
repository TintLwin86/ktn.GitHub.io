            <p><span id="b2" class="namebox">Beef</span> 
            Chuck meat is your best bet for beef stew, but it's also a pretty tough cut so it needs time to break down and become tender. Rush the cooking process and the beef will be tough and chewy. Follow this tip: For really tender meat, cook the stew low and slow, for approximately two hours.

            <p><span id="b3" class="namebox">Sushi</span>
            The trick is to zap it in the microwave for 30 seconds. (Just make sure you take it out of the container first, of course.) A little bit of heating will fluff up the rice and enhance those delicious flavors you love so much. A half a minute is the sweet spot for saving that store-bought sushi.</p>
